How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    If a bug is in one version but not the other, then it would show up in the 
differences of the two versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If you accidentally make a mistake, you can always go back to the previous 
version instead of having to debug again.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    If you do it manually, you can choose what version you want to save so that 
there won't be too many of them. If having versions automatically saved, you 
would not need to redo all your work if you are interrupted before you save it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git controls who can save the file and the final version. Google Docs saves 
all the changes according to time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to see the history log.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You are more confident because you can always undo anything easily.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try to use Git to save different versions of my own project.
